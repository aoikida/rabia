	The queue package defines an implementation of the ConsensusObj priority queue, which is used to sort (based on the
	proxy id and proxy sequence fields) and store pending proxy-batched requests.

	Note:
	1. A proxy-batched request contains one or more client-batched requests that are batched again by the proxy. The
	size (number of requests) of the batch depends on several parameters in Conf and the arrival time of client
	requests.
	2. Each consensus instance has its pending request queue, which means a server can have more than one queue when
	Concurrency is greater than 1.
	3. The priority queue follows the example at https://golang.org/pkg/container/heap
